# Software-Engineering-Team-Generator

  ## Description 
  
  This is a Node CLI (Command Line Interface) application, which prompts a user for information about the team manager and team members. It takes any number of team members, which is a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application generates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. Please preview the [demo HTML file](https://hjlogique.github.io/Software-Engineering-Team-Generator/output/team.html) generated by this application.

  ## Installation
  
  In command line type the `npm i` command to install the NPM package dependencies specified in the `package.json` file. They are [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user, and [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests. Next type `node app.js` to run the application. (watch the clip below)

  ## Usage 

  This application uses the `inquirer` NPM package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about the team manager and the team members. There are default questions like name, id and email, and specific ones like office number for the manager, GitHub username for engineers and school name for interns. The application takes your inputs, uses `async/await` to handle the `inquirer` promise, uses the `htmlRenderer.js` to generate an HTML format based on the main.html template, and uses the `fs.writeFileSync` from fs node module to generate a `team.html` file to display the team summary. The `path` node module accesses and interacts with the file system and generates a new directory for the `team.html` file in case `output` directory is missing.
